Usage
-----

To execute the whole livecyle including test to create the selrunner-0.1.jar. Put that into the lib folder of your FitNesse server installation. You will find the test report here: <project_home>/target/trinidad. Command to start the build:
mvn package 

You will need to start the FitNesse server in case you are going to work on the testcases in development mode. Start the FitNesse server command:
mvn exec:exec 

Note: After cloning or downloading the repository you will need to run mvn exec:exec at least once to unpack all the necessary wiki files. After that everything will work as expected (otherwise please let me know).
